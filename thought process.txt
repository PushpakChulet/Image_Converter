While starting this project, I had a few points in my mind,
like how to divide the image into equal parts, how to manage if one image comes out to be larger than the other one, and 
how to align them with each other. 

1. I read the image using the imread command and then got the size of input images
using the size command. I divided the image using the size command into three parts.

2. I considered the Green part as my benchmark and resized every other part to the size of the Green part using the imresize command.

3. The images, when merged without processing, images were producing white mostly, and to overcome this issue, I used imregconfig("multimodal")
and then compared the similarities in those three images taking green as the benchmark.

I used the cat command to combine those three aligned images.

The code can read images from the location specified by the user.
